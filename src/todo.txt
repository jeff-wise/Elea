Final list of TODOs

IsSet Type ??
Document clearly the indexing algorithms
add a lot more comments to valindex.hs
add a lot more comments to term types

names of system terms, make consistent/obvious


app wide settings
  * istext case sensitive?

indices search early returns/ cacheing
so that user can reuse types in constraints



notes:
  abstract syntax should be safe/correct
    but does not have to be succinct or super-elegant
