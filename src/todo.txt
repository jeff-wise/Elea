Final list of TODOs


coding conventions:
 rules for folds

refine elea.prelude


names of system terms, make consistent/obvious


app wide settings
  * istext case sensitive?

indices search early returns/ cacheing
so that user can reuse types in constraints

plan out sample apps based on biggest problem areas
 e.g. relations, and concurrency


will have to catch haskell exceptions e.g. divide by zero


should update index to check for dups?

text, num -- "one of" type
